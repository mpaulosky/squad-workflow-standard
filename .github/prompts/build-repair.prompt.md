# Copilot Build Prompt: Universal .NET Solution Build & Error Resolution

## Instructions

1. **Locate Solution File**

- Check for `*.slnx` file in current directory
- If found, continue to next step
- If not found, run: `cd ..` and check again
- Repeat until `*.slnx` file is found

1. **Restore Dependencies**

- Run: `dotnet restore`

1. **Build Solution**

- Run: `dotnet build --no-restore`
- Capture all build output, including errors and warnings.

1. **Error & Warning Resolution**

- For each error or warning in the build output:
  - Identify the affected file and line number.
  - Research the error/warning code and message.
  - Apply the recommended fix to the codebase.
  - Rebuild the solution to verify the fix.
  - Repeat until the build completes with zero errors and warnings.

1. **Verification**

- Ensure the final build output shows “Build succeeded” and no warnings.
- Document any changes made to resolve issues.

1. **Testing**

- Run unit tests to ensure the solution works as expected.
- If tests fail, identify and fix the issues in the codebase.
- Rebuild and retest until all tests pass.  

1. **Documentation**

- Create a `build-log.txt` file in the solution directory.
- Log all build outputs, error resolutions, and changes made.

## Notes

- These steps apply to any .NET solution (`*.slnx`).
- Use PowerShell or your default shell for commands.
- Always re-run the build after each fix to confirm resolution.

**Use this prompt to automate building and testing any .NET solution and iteratively resolve all build and test errors and warnings until the
build is clean.**
