## Steps

- Run `dotnet test tests/Unit.Tests` and ensure all tests pass with zero failures.
- Run `dotnet test tests/Blazor.Tests` and ensure all tests pass with zero failures.
- Run `dotnet test tests/Architecture.Tests` and ensure all tests pass with zero failures.
- If any test fails, fix the issue before pushing. CI must never be the first place test failures are discovered.
